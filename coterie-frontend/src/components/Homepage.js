          <p className="open-sans">Unique, important, uniqely important. A touch contemplative. Perhaps you're the chosen leader of the True people. Maybe you've even heard the Truth from on high -- a Truth that not everyone is willing to accept. You might be working endlessly to spread this word and bring those that accept this Truth to salvation. You might've thought about giving up this endeavor that the universe has compelled you to complete.</p>
          <p className="open-sans">We know it's not easy being in your position. From performing rituals and blessings to hesitantly punishing those in your flock who doubt the Truth, we know you do your best to make them fit for the next world.</p>
          <p className="open-sans">We understand that you need help in managing this organization of yours. After all, teaching your flock the ways of righteousness is not at easy task!</p>

          <p className="open-sans">Much like humans, flamingos are very social creatures. They tend to live in large colonies, with numbers ranging from 50 up to the thousands. They often communicate using non-verbal cues and engage in group activities. Flamingos form strong pair bonds with others of either the same sex or opposite sex, and they learn to recognize the calls of their parents and of their children so that they can hear them even in large colonies. As for the young, they form groups known as cr√®ches, and the entire colony will take on the burden of caring for them.</p>
